## My process
- i started with downloading Node JS on my Pc
- Then the installation of Tailwind css on this folder
- Created/Customized my colors, Heights, and Media query responsive widths on tailwind.config.Js file
- I did  my styling and wrote my content on Index.html

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Node Js

### What I learned

While Working through this project using Tailwind CSS rather than the normal process of styling it has significantly changed my approach to styling, by directly applying classes with multiple value to HTML elements, I've been able to create layouts and styles with minimal CSS overrides.

for example: 
```html
<h1 class=" bg-black text-center w-10 h-10">Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>ðŸŽ‰
ðŸŽ‰
